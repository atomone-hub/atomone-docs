# Engage with the AtomOne Community

Start by learning how you can contribute to AtomOne. Check out this simple guide on how to begin building with AtomOne.

## 1. Participate in Discussions

Atom.One is a community-driven ecosystem, and your voice matters. Join the conversation, ask questions, and share your thoughts on:

- [AtomOne Forum](https://commonwealth.im/atomone) & [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/atomone) – Stay updated, exchange ideas, and engage with fellow community members.
- [Twitter (@_atomone)](https://x.com/_atomone) – Follow for updates, discussions, and key announcements.
- [Reddit (r/atomone)](https://www.reddit.com/r/atomone/) – Join in-depth discussions and share insights with the broader community. 

## 2. Participate in Governance

AtomOne’s decisions are made through decentralized governance, and your participation helps shape the future of the ecosystem. Get involved by:

- Checking out the [governance page](https://gov.atom.one/) – Stay informed on proposals and upcoming votes.
- Voting on key decisions – Cast your vote on protocol upgrades, new proposed  modules/ implementations and other community initiatives
- Joining governance discussions – Share your perspectives on the forum, Discord, Twitter, and Reddit.


## 3. Contribute Code

AtomOne is built with open-source technologies, and there are many opportunities for developers to contribute. Whether you’re an expert in blockchain or a developer learning the ropes, you can help improve the network.

- [AtomOne Hub](https://github.com/atomone-hub) is where all of our community’s current efforts are placed.

## 4. Build Decentralized Applications

The AtomOne ecosystem welcomes decentralized applications (dApps) to leverage its blockchain interoperability and secure infrastructure. As a developer, you can create applications that interact with the AtomOne blockchain, either as a consumer or a validator.

## 5. Documentation and Writing

Not all contributions are code-related! Writing clear, comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and guides is crucial to make AtomOne more accessible to new users and developers.
