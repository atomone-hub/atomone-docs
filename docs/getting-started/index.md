# Overview

The AtomOne ecosystem is all about building a decentralized future through collaboration. Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or simply someone passionate about blockchain, there are plenty of ways you can jump in and contribute. 

Here’s a quick guide on how you can get started:

## 1. Participate in Discussions

One of the easiest ways to contribute is by simply getting involved in the ongoing discussions. AtomOne is a community-driven ecosystem, and your thoughts and ideas matter. You can:

- Join the [AtomOne forums](https://commonwealth.im/atomone) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/atomone) It's a great way to ask questions, share feedback, or even just see what's happening.
- The AtomOne ecosystem is decentralized, and decisions are made through community voting. Check out the [governance page](https://gov.atom.one/) and get involved in shaping the future of AtomOne.


## 2. Contribute Code

AtomOne is built with open-source technologies, and there are many opportunities for developers to contribute. Whether you’re an expert in blockchain or a developer learning the ropes, you can help improve the network.

- [AtomOne Hub](https://github.com/atomone-hub) is where all of our current efforts are placed.
- Once you're comfortable, dive into open issues, contribute fixes, build new features, or even improve these docs!
- If you have an idea for a new project, whether it’s a dApp or an entirely new blockchain, you can use the AtomOne SDK to make it happen.

## 3. Build Decentralized Applications

The AtomOne ecosystem thrives on decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage its blockchain interoperability. As a developer, you can create applications that interact with AtomOne based blockchains, either as a consumer or a validator.

While we do not currently have any tutorials to cover this, maybe consider writing some.

AtomOne is available for Leap and Keplr wallets.

If you're looking for endpoints, check out the validator info [here](https://github.com/atomone-hub/atomone-validator-community/pulls).

## 4. Documentation and Writing

Not all contributions are code-related! Writing clear, comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and guides is crucial to make AtomOne more accessible to new users and developers.

We're looking for:

- Written Tutorials
- Video Tutorials
- Articles
